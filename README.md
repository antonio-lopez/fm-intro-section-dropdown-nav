### What I learned

I learned about the mouseover and mouseenter event that I used to show and hide the desktop menu when the mouse hovers over the navbar options.

```
// shows the submenu pop up when hovering over a navbar option
<li class="relative">
	// navbar option
	<a id="features-desktop">Features</a>
	// list container
	<div id="features-list-desktop" class="absolute...">
		<ul id="features-menu">
			<li>Todo List</li>
			<li>Calendar</li>
			<li>Reminders</li>
			<li>Planning</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</li>

// JS
const featuresDesktop = document.getElementById('features-desktop');
const featuresContainer = document.getElementById('features-list-desktop');
const featuresMenu = document.getElementById('features-menu');

featuresDesktop.addEventListener('mouseenter', () => {
	featuresContainer.classList.toggle('hidden');
});

featuresMenu.addEventListener('mouseleave', () => {
	featuresContainer.classList.toggle('hidden');
});

```

### Useful resources

- [Mouseoever Event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mouseover_event) - The mouseover event is fired at an Element when a pointing device (such as a mouse or trackpad) is used to move the cursor onto the element or one of its child elements.
- [Mouseenter Event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mouseenter_event) - The mouseenter event is fired at an Element when a pointing device (usually a mouse) is initially moved so that its hotspot is within the element at which the event was fired.
